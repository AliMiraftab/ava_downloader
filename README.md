For the sake of convenience, I put the download link above (via [Reddit](https://redd.it/5sa3ag))

AVA is a large-Scale database for aesthetic visual analysis containing 250000+ photos from dpchallenge.com.

However, the downloaded pakage only contains image list and annotations. You may need the script to download AVA images from website.

~~- Known Issue~~

~~With this script keep sending requests to dpchallenge.com, **the website would block your ip address for some time.**
So, I'm trying to figure out another way to download all the pictures from the site.
Contact me if you have any. Thank you!

~~## Usage~~

~~1. Download ava_downloader.py to any directory you like.~~

~~2. Make sure you have downloaded AVA Database (zip, 4.2 MB) from the [site](http://www.lucamarchesotti.com/ava/download/start_download.html).~~

~~3. Unzip AVA_dataset.zip and place AVA.txt under the same directory as the script. Also create a folder 'image'~~

~~4. Run the script with command $python ava_downloader.py *beginIndex endIndex*~~

~~5. **Tips:** Note that *beginIndex* and *endIndex* both range from 1 to 25553. Downloading all the images would **consume a lot of time**. It is recommended you download a small amount once a time.~~

~~## More~~

~~- [ ] Multithreading download~~
~~- [ ] Catch errors~~

Happy downloading~ :sunglasses:
